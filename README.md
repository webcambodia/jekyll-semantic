# Jekyll + Semantic UI + Netlify = Quick and Clean Websites

Three Open Source Resources come together to accomplish just about everything you need; fast, secure, and awesome!  

## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
Jekyll is a static site generator. That is, you get to write your websites using all kinds of shortcuts like css pre-processors, templates, variables, and other nerdy stuff - but then just generate static websites for really simple and fast hosting. For simple sites like this, it is perfect!

## [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
Semantic UI is a set of javascript and css modules that let you build an awesome UI really easily. It uses gulp, an nodejs build tool, and LESS, a different css pre-processor than Jekyll. There are SCSS versions of it out there, but they are not official.  

## [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
The secret sauce to bring it all together.
